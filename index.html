                  The Rhode Island Stone Wall Mapping Project (RISWMP) was completed in 2025. It is the only comprehensive survey of its kind for Rhode Island, serving as the foundation for scientific and community initiatives state-wide.

                  Over 5,000 miles of walls were inventoried using an original methodology applied to the 2022 Rhode Island Statewide LiDAR dataset. The wall networks reveal a rich agricultural history influenced by settlement patterns, indigenous relationships, topography, and soil.
                </p>
                <p>
                  These relics are under threat from development, vandalism, and theft. RISWMP actively promotes historical preservation efforts and educational opportunities throughout southern New England.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the completion of the delineation phase of the study, RISWMP has moved into its maintenance, research, and outreach phase. Minor oversights, errors, and other flaws exist in this dataset. In this new phase, RISWMP data is dynamic and evolving. Research is being conducted from several perspectives, including  wall geohistorical patterns, ecohistory, and ecology. Additionally, work is being done to place Rhode Island's stone walls in the context of the rest of New England.
