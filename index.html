                  The Rhode Island Stone Wall Mapping Project (RISWMP) was completed in 2025. It is the only comprehensive survey of its kind for Rhode Island, serving as the foundation for scientific and community initiatives state-wide.
                </p>
            </section>

            <div class="details">
                <p>
                  Over 5,000 miles of walls were inventoried using an original methodology applied to the 2022 Rhode Island Statewide LiDAR dataset. The wall networks reveal a rich agricultural history influenced by settlement patterns, indigenous relationships, topography, and soil.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With the completion of the delineation phase of the study, RISWMP has moved into its maintenance, research, and outreach phase. Research is being conducted from several perspectives, including  wall geohistorical patterns, ecohistory, and ecology.
                </p>
                <p>
                  RISWMP actively promotes educational opportunities throughout southern New England on historical preservation and environmental conservation.
